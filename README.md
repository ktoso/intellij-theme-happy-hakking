> The *ideal* colour scheme for all your Akka development! Happy Hakking! -- me

Custom colour scheme (without the background) by myself.

Mostly for Scala, but works nice with everything else.

Note also: 

- Traits, classes and object have slightly different colour.
- `var`iables differ in colour from `val`ues

Usage
-----

Import it into intellij and the scheme shows up as `Darkula - akka`
